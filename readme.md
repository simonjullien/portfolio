# RESN TEMPLATE
This is the starting point for most of our projects. 
It has a lot of stuff in there. The way we usually use it is clonig the project and getting rid of the parts we won't need.

It consists of a backbone application with a couple of default routes/views, some libraries included and many utilities.
It uses require.js for module loading

## stuff included
- backbone
- resn flash framework
- cdn integration
- grunt for minifying scripts and other tasks
- handlebars for templating
- createjs suite (preload, movieclips, sound...)
- require.js

## refactoring
At the moment we're refactoring many things. Things may be unstable.
There are docs in the docs folder with refactoring todo and info on library upgrades.
